👋 Hey there, I'm Thomas Eduardo!
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Business/Requirements Analyst, development student, always exploring the exciting world of code and technology. If you're here, you're probably interested in my work and I'm so happy to share it with you!

🛠️ What I Do
I'm a Business/Requirements Analyst passionate about problem solving, with solid experience in the telecommunications area and in FTTH network plants.

I love learning new things and applying those skills to real-world challenges. Whether it’s building sleek user interfaces, optimizing performance, or diving deep into data, you can find me experimenting with it all.

🌱 What I'm Currently Learning
Linux Server: Going deeper into this because IT/Networks use their resource in essence, which brings mandatory knowledge
JavaScript: This is my first language, where I am developing my basic knowledge
Python: Integrations between network assets and webservers are my goals.

⚡ Fun Facts About Me
I am passionate about knowledge, especially in the area of ​​technology, and I want to become a "walking library" where I can contribute key points to help those around me.
I believe in continuous learning and I try to improve my skills every day.
I love collaborating with people who share the same passion for technology!
